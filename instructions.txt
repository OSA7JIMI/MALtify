Future Upgrades:

0. Fix bug: set query = title + ' by ' + nickname
and do string matching with result to get correct song
1. Add: retrieve recently completed anime by sorting by date 
instead of repeating the process for the whole list again
2. Improve: filter the Japanese song titles into a seperate column 
in songs_df
3. Add: OSTs
4. Improve: auto refresh access token
5. Automatically update Spotify playlist whenever a new anime 
is marked as completed (or periodically e.g. weekly if the first 
one requires too much energy)
6. Add: frontend website hosted on local server with fields to 
enter MAL username, Spotify username, and desired playlist name.
So that the code can all be executed by pressing one button
